EPUBcheck may seem like software for digital publishing professionals and you may encounter doubts or problems using it, but don't worry, there are several ways to ask for help:

- If you have difficulty interpreting the messages in the EPUBcheck report – which can sometimes be a bit cryptic – you can refer to the [message guide](../messages/)
- If you still you still have doubts on the meaning of the messages or if you encounter problems running EPUBcheck, you can try asking the [#eprdctn community](https://twitter.com/hashtag/eprdctn): it's an informal group of nice folks that work in the digital publishing field (from all over the world); we are sure there will be someone ready to answer you.
- Finally, if the problem seems unsolvable, you can [open an issue on Github](/docs/dev/issues), where the EPUBcheck developers are listening, to fix all the bugs of the tool
